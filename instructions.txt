This app can make a simple math operations with your numbers.

USE INTEGER NUMBERS ONLY, NO FLOATING POINTS
USE ONLY 4 BASIC OPERATION SYMBOLS:  *, /, +, -
but if you're a mother's hacker,
there is a check into a program,
which won't let you enter the wrong data

navigation:
use letters as commands to stop and continue,
* register and eng/ru doesn't matter

calculation:
1) enter the number A (for example, you entered 10)
2) enter the second number B (for example, you entered 5
3) enter the operation symbol (for example, you entered /)
4) the program will place your symbols the following order:
    A divided by B is RESULT (10 / 5 = 2)
5) then you'll see the result
